I am a undergraduate student in GIST. My major is Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am interested in Machine Learning.

I am currently working as a part-time machine learing reasearcher at VIVE Studios, and my specific field is Talking Head synthesis, but I am also interested in other fields of machine learing too.

My hobby is to walk or play the piano and besides Computer Science I am also interested in mathematics.
