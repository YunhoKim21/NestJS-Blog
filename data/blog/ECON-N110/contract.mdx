## Contracts

- _Contract_ is an agreement about behavior that is intended to be enforced.
  Contracts are intended to be executed, but might not always be excecuted.

- The following is one example of procedure that contracts can be enforced.

1. Players form a contract.
2. They play the underlying game (called production).
3. An external enforcer (court, arbitrator, etc. ) observes the outcome of the underlying game and compels transfers.

- There are two types of enforcement : _self-enforcement_ and _external enforcement_.

- _Self enforcement_ is when the nash equilibrium is already the desired result. For an example, there is the pareto coordination game.

|     | A    | B    |
| --- | ---- | ---- |
| A   | 2, 2 | 0, 0 |
| B   | 0, 0 | 1, 1 |

- In this case, if players talk to each other to choose A, that contract will be executed without and external enforcement.

- In contrast, _external enforcement_ is when external entity has to compel in order to make players play the desired strategy.

## Example : production game

- The underlying game is,

|     | I          | N          |
| --- | ---------- | ---------- |
| I   | $z_1, z_2$ | $y_1, x_2$ |
| N   | $x_1, y_2$ | 1, 1       |

- I indicates invest, and N indicates not invest. The situation where both are investing is the desired result,
  but players might devicate from this strategy profile.
- Assume that I, I is the most efficient outcome. So, following conditions must be true.

<center>$$z_1 + z_2 > y_1 + x_2$$ $$z_1 + z_2 > x_1 + y_2$$</center>

- In this case, assume that individuals have incentive to deviate from intended strategy (I, I). We can make a contract here like below.

|     | I                            | N                          |
| --- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| I   | $z_1, z_2$                   | $y_1 + \beta, x_2 - \beta$ |
| N   | $x_1 + \alpha, y_2 - \alpha$ | $\gamma, -\gamma$          |

- Note that $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in R$. i.e. they can also be negative numbers.

- For the contract to be enforced, it should make playing I be benifical than playing N for both players.

<center>$$z_1 \geq x_1 + \alpha$$ $$z_2 \geq x+2 - \beta$$</center>

- Contract obeying the conditions above can be enforced.

## Two inportant issues:

1. Trying to achieve and "efficient outcome", the payoffs must be **transferable**.
2. Verifiability constrants : The external enforcer may not be able to verify exactly what happened in the underlying game.

- Full verifiability: A setting in which the external enforcer (e.g. the court) is able to
  perfectly differentiate between all of the different outcomes of the
  underlying game.

- Limited verifiability: A setting in which the external enforcer is NOT able to perfectly
  differentiate between all of the different outcomes of the
  underlying game.

## Example

|     | I        | N       |
| --- | -------- | ------- |
| I   | $8, 8$   | $-4, 4$ |
| N   | $10, -2$ | $0, 0$  |

- The efficient outcome is when (I, I) is played, but unfortunately (I, I) is not the nash equilibrium.
- Assume there is limited verifiability.

|     | I                          | N                         |
| --- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| I   | $8, 8$                     | $-4 + \alpha, 4 - \alpha$ |
| N   | $10 + \alpha, -2 - \alpha$ | $0 + \alpha, 0 - \alpha$  |

- For (I, I) to be the nash equilibrium, two conditions must be satisfied.

<center>
$$8 \geq 10 + \alpha \Rightarrow \alpha \leq -2$$

$$8 \geq 4 - \alpha \Rightarrow \alpha \geq -4$$

</center>

- There are many $\alpha$ satisfing both conditions, for example $\alpha = -3$. But in other cases,
  there might be no $\alpha$ that satisfies both conditions.

## Contracting with Court-Imposed Breach Remedies

- The parties specify just how they want to coordinate in the
  underlying game.
  If a breach occurs, the external enforcer compels a transfer
  according to a legal rule. Three common ones:

1. **Expectation damages** : make the plaintiff (harmed party) as
   well off as he/she would have been had no breach occurred.

2. **Reliance damages** : return the plaintiff to a payoff that would
   have occurred with no contract (zero).

3. **Restitution damages** : return the defendant (offending party)
   to a payoff that would have occurred with no contract (zero).
