## Contracts

- _Contract_ is an agreement about behavior that is intended to be enforced.
  Contracts are intended to be executed, but might not always be excecuted.

- The following is one example of procedure that contracts can be enforced.

1. Players form a contract.
2. They play the underlying game (called production).
3. An external enforcer (court, arbitrator, etc. ) observes the outcome of the underlying game and compels transfers.

- There are two types of enforcement : _self-enforcement_ and _external enforcement_.

- _Self enforcement_ is when the nash equilibrium is already the desired result. For an example, there is the pareto coordination game.

|     | A    | B    |
| --- | ---- | ---- |
| A   | 2, 2 | 0, 0 |
| B   | 0, 0 | 1, 1 |

- In this case, if players talk to each other to choose A, that contract will be executed without and external enforcement.

- In contrast, _external enforcement_ is when external entity has to compel in order to make players play the desired strategy.
