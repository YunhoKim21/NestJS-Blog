## Contracts

- _Contract_ is an agreement about behavior that is intended to be enforced.
  Contracts are intended to be executed, but might not always be excecuted.

- The following is one example of procedure that contracts can be enforced.

1. Players form a contract.
2. They play the underlying game (called production).
3. An external enforcer (court, arbitrator, etc. ) observes the outcome of the underlying game and compels transfers.

- There are two types of enforcement : _self-enforcement_ and _external enforcement_.

- _Self enforcement_ is when the nash equilibrium is already the desired result. For an example, there is the pareto coordination game.

|     | A    | B    |
| --- | ---- | ---- |
| A   | 2, 2 | 0, 0 |
| B   | 0, 0 | 1, 1 |

- In this case, if players talk to each other to choose A, that contract will be executed without and external enforcement.

- In contrast, _external enforcement_ is when external entity has to compel in order to make players play the desired strategy.

## Example : production game

- The underlying game is,

|     | I          | N          |
| --- | ---------- | ---------- |
| I   | $z_1, z_2$ | $y_1, x_2$ |
| N   | $x_1, y_2$ | 1, 1       |

- I indicates invest, and N indicates not invest. The situation where both are investing is the desired result,
  but players might devicate from this strategy profile.
- Assume that I, I is the most efficient outcome. So, following conditions must be true.

<center>$$z_1 + z_2 > y_1 + x_2$$ $$z_1 + z_2 > x_1 + y_2$$</center>

- In this case, assume that individuals have incentive to deviate from intended strategy (I, I). We can make a contract here like below.

|     | I                            | N                          |
| --- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| I   | $z_1, z_2$                   | $y_1 + \beta, x_2 - \beta$ |
| N   | $x_1 + \alpha, y_2 - \alpha$ | $\gamma, -\gamma$          |

- Note that $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in R$. i.e. they can also be negative numbers.

- For the contract to be enforced, it should make playing I be benifical than playing N for both players.

<center>$$z_1 \geq x_1 + \alpha$$ $$z_2 \geq x+2 - \beta$$</center>

- Contract obeying the conditions above can be enforced.

## Two inportant issues:

1. Trying to achieve and "efficient outcome", the payoffs must be **transferable**.
2. Verifiability constrants : The external enforcer may not be able to verify exactly what happened in the underlying game.

-Full verifiability: A setting in which the external enforcer (e.g. the court) is able to
perfectly differentiate between all of the different outcomes of the
underlying game.

-Limited verifiability: A setting in which the external enforcer is NOT able to perfectly
differentiate between all of the different outcomes of the
underlying game.
