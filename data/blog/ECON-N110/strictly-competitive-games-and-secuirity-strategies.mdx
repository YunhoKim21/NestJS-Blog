## Strictly competitive game

- A two-player game is **strictly competitive** if, for any two strategy profiles $s$ and $s'$,
  $u_1(s) \geq u_1(s')$ if and only if $u_2(s) \leq u_2(s')$.
- $s_i$ is a **security strategy** for player $i$ if it solves:

<center> 
$$\max_{s_i \in S_i} \min_{s_j \in S_j} u_i(s)$$
</center>

- Note that a secure strategy might not be rationalizable.
- Player i's **security level** is the corresponding payoff.

## Result

- If $s^*$ is a nash equilibrium of a _strictly competitive game_, then $s^*_1$ and $s^*_2$ are security strategies for player 1 and player 2.

### Example

|     | F    | C    | B    |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| F   | 0, 5 | 2, 3 | 2, 3 |
| C   | 2, 3 | 0, 5 | 3, 2 |
| B   | 5, 0 | 3, 2 | 2, 3 |

- We first find the security strategies for player 1 and player 2. For player 1, playing B would be the security strategy and
  for player 2, playing C or B will be the secure strategy. (_Why?_) Thus, the secure startegy set is, $\{(B, C), (B, B)\}$
