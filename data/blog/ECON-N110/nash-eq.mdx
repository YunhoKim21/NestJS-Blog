- In this article, we are going to discuss about Nash equilibrium.

## Motivation

- previously, we tried to determine and predict the course of game by using iterative dominance.
- However, we noticed that even with iterative dominance some games remained inconclusive.
- We want to investigate more on these games by using **nash equilibrium**.

## Definition of Nash equilibrium

- A **Nash equilibrium** is the case in which all strategic uncertainty has
  been removed, so players behave exactly as others believe they will
  behave.
- A strategy profile $$s \in S$$ is a Nash equilibrium if and only if $$s_i \in BR_i(s_{-i})$$
  for each player i. That is, $$u_i(s_i, s_{-i}) \geq u_i(s_i', s_{-i}) $$ for every $$s_i' \in S_i$$ and i.

## Finding nash equilibrium

- Let the normal form of game be,

|     | a    | b    | c    |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| w   | 3, 2 | 3, 2 | 2, 3 |
| x   | 3, 2 | 1, 1 | 5, 4 |
| y   | 4, 4 | 2, 3 | 1, 3 |
| z   | 3, 6 | 0, 4 | 4, 7 |

- In order to find nash equilibrium, we want to find coordinates in this table where both players are best responding.
- Let's bold player 1's best response.

|     | a        | b        | c        |
| --- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| w   | 3, 2     | **3**, 2 | 2, 3     |
| x   | 3, 2     | 1, 1     | **5**, 4 |
| y   | **4**, 4 | 2, 3     | 1, 3     |
| z   | 3, 6     | 0, 4     | 4, 7     |

- and then, bold player 2's best response.

|     | a            | b        | c            |
| --- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| w   | 3, 2         | **3**, 2 | 2, **3**     |
| x   | 3, 2         | 1, 1     | **5**, **4** |
| y   | **4**, **4** | 2, 3     | 1, 3         |
| z   | 3, 6         | 0, 4     | 4, **7**     |

- Recall that both players must be best responding to each other.
- Thus, two strategy profiles are in nash equilibrium, (y, a) and (x, c)
- Note that one of these strategy profile (y, a) is not efficient, i.e. there is another strategy profile (x, c) that is more efficient.

## Intuition behind Nash equilibrium

- A strategy profile (state) is a Nash equilibrium _if and only if_ no player in the game has any incentive to unilaterally deviate from current strategy profile.
- This means that no one in the game actually wants to change their stategy, unless they can talk to each other.
- This statement above gives a reason why nash equilibrium is useful and stable.

## When Nash equilibrium is enforced

- iterative game
- mediation
- pre-play communication

## Strict Nash Equilibrium

- A nash equlilbrium is a strict nash equilibrium if and only if for every player i, thier best response is thier only best response.
- i.e. when the payoff is strctly larger than any other options.
