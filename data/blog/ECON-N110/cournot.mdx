- In this article, we are going to look at cournot models, where firms compete in an oligopoly.

## Modeling the situaiton

- Imagine that we have two firms producing homogeneous products.
- Each firm can choose it's quantity, $$q_i \in [0, \infty), i = 1, 2$$
- Each unit of production, the firm has to pay c, the production cost. Assume the production cost remains constant.
- The price is determined by the market, by the formula below
  $$p(Q) = a - Q$$
- Note that the price decreases as quantity increases. Q indicates the total amout of quantity.
- Each firm wants to maximize it's own profit.

## Normal form of Cournot Model

- for those who do not know normal form, it's just the matematical descripion of player's options and utility function (the payoff).
- $$n=2$$
- $$S_i = [0, \infty), i = 1, 2$$
- $$u_i(q_i, q_j) = q_i (a - q_i-q_j) - cq_i$$

## Finding the best response function

- Let us be in the side of firm 1. We want to maximize our profit, by altering our production.
- Note that our utility function,
  $$u_1(q_1, q_2) = q_1(a - q_1 - q_2) - cq_1$$
- is a parabola upside down, in respect to $$q_1$$
- Thus, we take the derivative of our utility function in respect to our quantity.
  $\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial q_1} = a - c - q_2 - 2q_1 = 0$
- Thus, our best response is,
  $$q^*_1 = \frac{a - c- q_2}{2} $$
- Note that the situation is symmetric, we also have our best response function for firm 2,
  $$q^*_2 = \frac{a - c- q_1}{2} $$

## Finding Nash equilibrium

- Recall that in nash equilibrium, both firms would have to have no incentive to unilaterally devicate from current strategy profile.
- That means, both firms are best responding to each other.
- Thus, both equations must hold.
  $$q^*_1 = \frac{a - c- q^*_2}{2}$$
  $$q^*_2 = \frac{a - c- q^*_2}{2}$$
- Solving this equation, we obtain the nash equilibrium, which is,
  $$q^*_1 = q^*_2 = \frac{a - c}{3}$$
