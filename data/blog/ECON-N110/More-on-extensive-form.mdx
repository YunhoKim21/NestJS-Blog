## Quick review : Extensive form representation

- Nodes: Where players choose actions - Successor Nodes : Node B is a successor to Node A if there is some path going from
  A to B. - Immediate Successor : B is an immediate successor to A if there is a branch leading
  directly from A to B. - Predecessor Nodes : Same idea as successor nodes but moving through the tree
  backwards.
- Branches: Specific actions.
- Labels: Identify nodes or branches.
- Payoffs: Represent preferences over outcomes.
- Information sets: Reveal what a player knows when he/she makes a decision.
  - A playerâ€™s strategy must give a decision for each of his/her info sets.

## Example

![tree example](/static/images/game-thoery/tree1.png)

- Initial Node : a
- All successors to a : b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k
- All immediate successors to a : b, c
- All predecessor node to f : a, b, d
- All immediate predecessor node to f : d
- Information sets :
  - player 1 : $\{a\}, \{d\}, \{e\}$
  - player 2 : $\{b, c\}$

## Tree rules

- Following are the rules that game tree must obey.

1. Every node is a successor of the initial node, and the initial node is the only one
   with this property.
2. Each node except the initial node has exactly one immediate predecessor. The
   initial node has no predecessors.
3. Multiple branches extending from the same node have different action labels.
4. Each information set contains decision nodes for only one of the players.
5. All nodes in a given information set must have the same number of immediate
   successors and they must have the same set of action labels on the branches
   leading to these successors. (if not, it is trivial that the player can distinguish states. )

## Representing infinite action space

- We can use dotted line to represent simultaneous move games.

- The Stackelberg game, represented by the graph above, is a variation of [cournot game](./cournot) we looked before.
- The difference here is that it is not simultaneous. Thus the strategy spaces are,

<center> 
$$S_1 = [0, \infty) \\$$
$$S_2 = \{ f : [0, \infty) \rightarrow [0, \infty) \}$$
</center>

- Note that strategy space of player 2 is **not** positive real number, becuase player 2 can decide with information of player 1's decision.

## Perfect Recall

- Perfect recall is when players remember what they did previously.
- Following diagram represents an example of imperfect recall. Note that player 1 cannot distinguish two states.

- If every information set is a single node, then the game is of perfect
  information. (when there are no dashed lines in the extensive form)
- Otherwise, the game is of imperfect information. (when there is any
  dashed line in the extensive form)
